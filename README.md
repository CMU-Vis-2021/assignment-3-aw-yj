# A3 Project Goal
In this project, we are interested in discovering TESLA's stock price fluctuations. Since Tesla's stock price changes significantly every day for the past few months, we are interested to see the 


# Design Decisions
We think a line chart will work best if we want to show a trend for stock price, and we intended to create a filter with "high", "low", "open", "close" to see the changes in the stock price line in different situations.  

# Overview of your development process

We both spent a day ( ~10 hours) coding from our end and 2 hours to meet and compile the online file. (in total, 12 hours per person)
Since we both are programming newcomers, we spent a lot of time trying to clone the Github file to the local document, and use VScode to push updates. To make the chart interactive, we looked upon different online tutorials and found  Graph Gallery really helpful. We followed the code instruction and modulated the code based on our own needs.
One challenge we encountered was to make the "main.js" work on the HTML file. We still do not know the reason, but when deleting "type=module" in the <scrip> code, the javascript codes could be reflected in the HTML file.




# a3-template

Template for Assignment 3. It comes pre-loaded with D3 and Vega.

## Setup

This template uses the same setup as the D3 crashcourse template.

To run it, use the following commands:

1. Install Node.js and NPM from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2. Clone this repository, and cd into the directory.
3. Open VSCode and open the folder you just cloned.
4. In this folder, run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
5. Open the URL displayed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:3000/). If you open the html file directly, your changes will not update the website.
6. Run `npm run dev` to watch for changes and host the web application.

You can add any changes to github using `git add .` and `git commit -m "message"` and `git push origin master`.

Please email [cabrera@cmu.edu](mailto:cabrera@cmu.edu) if you run into any issues, or come to office hours for debugging.
